"If ``sigma`` gets too small, eventually the rating change volatility will"

"You can represent the decay of a player's skill over time by increasing "
"``sigma`` by a little per match not played (or every time interval). "
"First collect data on by how much sigma goes up or down by resetting "
"sigma to it's default value per interval. The value by which ``sigma`` "
"should change must be an average of the change of ``sigma`` over all "
"matches when ``sigma`` is reset per interval."
